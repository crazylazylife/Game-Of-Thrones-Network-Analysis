# Game-Of-Thrones-Network-Analysis
A simple project in DataCamp on the character network analysis from the original books of the series Game of Thrones

This is based on the project requirements in the DataCamp Projects section. Here is the link: https://learn.datacamp.com/projects/76

A blog on a more extensive analysis on both the series and books can be found here:

Give it a read. This is one of the most detatiled analysis and also beautifully explained.
